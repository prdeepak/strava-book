# Period in Review - Naming Issues
* YearStats still appears as [Year] Summary in TOC
* Year at a Glance still reads that way in TOC
* Year at a Glance is still showing the ending Year, not the period selected

# RaceSpread Template
* RaceSpread template is pretty terrible, needs review
* May need to adjust visual-judge to assess how well a section hangs together, not just each page separately

# Month Dividers
* If no photos, left-side divider page should be blank; currently has month name
* Right-side divider page: calendar is falling off bottom of page; no comments or descriptions or highlights of any sort

# Activity Log
* Activity Log entries should include: descriptions; kudo count; comments; photos if possible (may be hard given Strava API call limits?)
