* Added color-utils.ts with contrast-safe color functions
* Added accentForWhiteBg and accentBackground to all color schemes

# Fix title + CoverPage ✅ DONE (PR #54)
* Removed separate "title" field - periodName is now the book title
* Removed "By" prefix before athlete name
* Adjusted font sizing for cleaner look

# Foreword generator ✅ DONE (PR #54)
* Added magic wand button in BookGenerationModal
* Created claude-client.ts and foreword-generator.ts
* Note: Uses Anthropic API directly (not AWS Bedrock) - can migrate later if needed

# Table of Contents ✅ DONE (PR #54)
* Fixed category ordering: Overview → Races → Training Log → Highlights
* Removed Activity Log entries from TOC (only show divider pages)
* Removed leader dots - clean layout with page numbers right-aligned
* Fixed BookDocument to use TableOfContentsPage (not Document-wrapped version)

# Period in Review 🔴 ISSUES IDENTIFIED
* curator.ts: rename "Year at a Glance" and "Year Stats / Year Summary" -> "Period at a Glance", "Period Summary"

**Known Issues (observed 2026-01-13):**
* Text is too large and awkward
* No commas in thousands for distance, elevation, etc.
* Activity graph shows fixed Jan-Dec instead of actual activity period months
* Should show months in order they occurred (e.g., July → Jan for a period starting in July)
* Possible confusion between YearStats and YearAtAGlance templates - need to clarify which is which

**Original requirements:**
* Year_Stats and Year_at_a_Glance statistics and graphs should include only the period chosen for the book
* Currently seems to include a much longer period, e.g., all activities pulled from Strava in this session

# RaceSpread template
* create a RaceSpread template that is anywhere from 1 to 4+ pages long, depending on the amount of content available about the race. This will be used for the race spreads in the book.  Essentially, include everything possible -- starting with the most emotionally resonant content near the front; e.g., hero photo + map if exists; description, photos, kudos + comments by others; then PRs, splits, elevation, etc.
* This should be the default template used for race spreads in the book.
* If a race has its own known color scheme, use that; otherwise, use the default fonts and color scheme.
* PRs should be shown similarly to race_2p -- i.e., with a gold, silver, bronze background if in the top 1, 2, 3 to-date

# Month Dividers
* MonthDividers should be 2 pages -- left and right.  Perhaps photos on the left, calendar and comments, etc, on the right? 
* Include a calendar for the month, in strava-streaks style (use existing component); if almost all activities are the same type (e.g., all runs), then use the strava-training style component
* Create a "default hierarchy" of activites within the month -- e.g., each activity is given points for the number of PRs it includes, or if it's in the top-5 by kudos / comments, relative effort, distance, elevation, etc.  Then, sort the activities within the month based on this hierarchy.
* Use the default hierarchy to choose photos and comments to display on the monthly divider page (e.g., comments with the most likes go first; then sorted by highest-hierarchy-points first)

# Activity Log
* Activity Log entries should include: descriptions; kudo count; comments; photos if possible (may be hard given Strava API call limits?)
