# Fix Known Race Colors
* KNOWN_RACE_COLORS: if primary or accent won't meet contrast requirements against a white background, come up with a new background (or adjust the accent color so it will work). Alternatively, come up with an "accent background" color -- for all color schemes -- that should be used on pages (e.g., Year_Stats) where the primary text is in the accent color

# Fix title + CoverPage
* Drop "book title" in GenerateBook modal, on CoverPage and wherever else it is used
* Use PeriodName as the book title
* CoverPage: drop the work "By" ahead of AthleteName
* CoverPage: adjust title font size, to fit text smoothly on the page

# Foreword generator
* In Foreword box within GenerateBook modal, add a magic wand button to generate a foreword by sending race comments (and other comments?) to Claude Sonnet 3.5 via AWS Bedrock. Instruction something like: "Write a foreword for a running book based on these race comments. Write in first-person, in a voice as close as possible to the athlete's writing style."
* Same AI prompt would suggest a new book title / period name
* In the same branch / PR, change any existing AI API calls from Gemini to Claude Sonnet 3.5 (via AWS Bedrock)

# Table of Contents
* Fix TOC template, using /ralph-loop and visual-judge.  Currently a total mess -- wrong page size, therefore everything else is terrible too.

# Period in Review
* curator.ts: rename "Year at a Glance" and "Year Stats / Year Summary" -> "Period at a Glance", "Period Summary"
* For Year_at_a_Glance and Year_Stats templates: use /ralph-loop and visual-judge to improve the design ... font is terrible; characters are too large; amounts with thousands (e.g., distance, elevation) need commas
* Year_Stats and Year_at_a_Glance statistics and graphs should include only the period chosen for the book. Currently seems to include a much longer period, e.g., all activities pulled from Strava in this session

# RaceSpread template
* create a RaceSpread template that is anywhere from 1 to 4+ pages long, depending on the amount of content available about the race. This will be used for the race spreads in the book.  Essentially, include everything possible -- starting with the most emotionally resonant content near the front; e.g., hero photo + map if exists; description, photos, kudos + comments by others; then PRs, splits, elevation, etc.
* This should be the default template used for race spreads in the book.
* If a race has its own known color scheme, use that; otherwise, use the default fonts and color scheme.
* PRs should be shown similarly to race_2p -- i.e., with a gold, silver, bronze background if in the top 1, 2, 3 to-date

# Month Dividers
* MonthDividers should be 2 pages -- left and right.  Perhaps photos on the left, calendar and comments, etc, on the right? 
* Include a calendar for the month, in strava-streaks style (use existing component); if almost all activities are the same type (e.g., all runs), then use the strava-training style component
* Create a "default hierarchy" of activites within the month -- e.g., each activity is given points for the number of PRs it includes, or if it's in the top-5 by kudos / comments, relative effort, distance, elevation, etc.  Then, sort the activities within the month based on this hierarchy.
* Use the default hierarchy to choose photos and comments to display on the monthly divider page (e.g., comments with the most likes go first; then sorted by highest-hierarchy-points first)

# Activity Log
* Activity Log entries should include: descriptions; kudo count; comments; photos if possible (may be hard given Strava API call limits?)
